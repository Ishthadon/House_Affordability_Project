# 🏠 Housing Affordability Trends in California (2017 vs. 2022)
This project explores the ongoing housing affordability crisis in California by analyzing public microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2017 and 2022. The study focuses on how financial status, demographic factors, and essential costs (like rent and mortgage) impact the ability of residents to afford housing.

## ⚠️ This project was originally built using Excel for trend visualization. I attempted to replicate and extend it using code, but the results and visualizations vary due to differences in tools and methods.

## 📌 Project Summary
Scope: California housing trends post-2008 crash and post-COVID housing boom.

-Time Frame: Comparative study of 2017 vs. 2022 data.

-Primary Tools: Original (Excel), Current Version (Python-based analysis).

## 🧠 Objectives
Identify key factors influencing homeownership and affordability.

Highlight racial and economic disparities in housing access.

Track trends over time and understand their socio-economic impact.

## 🔍 Research Questions
-How does income level affect the ability to afford a home?

-What are the major trends in affordability over the past 5 years?

-Are there racial disparities in access to affordable housing?

-How much of their income do people spend on housing costs?

## 🗂️ Key Features & Analysis
Engineered Features:

-Income Groups

-Percent of Income Spent on Housing

-Multiracial Category

Main Variables Analyzed:

-Income

-Food Stamp status

-Rent & Mortgage

-Race (as a demographic indicator)

## 📊 Key Findings
-Average 3.5% increase in mortgage burden between 2017 and 2022.

-Over 65% of households fall into a low-income bracket.

-Significant affordability gaps remain across racial groups.

-Only 4.7% (mortgage) and 7.8% (rent) of Californians are entirely priced out of housing.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Housing Support Program (HSP):

-Wage subsidies for employees at risk of housing instability.

-$17 million simulated employer support program proposed under California's Budget Act of 2021.

## ❗ Limitations
Time constraints prevented implementation of predictive machine learning models.

External factors (utilities, healthcare, etc.) were not included in the current analysis but are relevant.

## 📎 Files Included
-PowerPoint presentation summarizing trends and insights.

-Scripts (if uploaded) replicating the analysis in Python.

-Cleaned data & feature engineering logic (if available).
